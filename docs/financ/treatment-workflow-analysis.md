    @ManyToOne Procedure procedure        // Medical procedure performed
    @ManyToOne Staff doctor               // Performing doctor
    
    // Treatment Details
    Integer toothNumber                   // For dental procedures (11-48)
    TreatmentStatus status                // PLANNED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, etc.
    BigDecimal cost                       // Treatment cost
    String treatmentNotes                 // Clinical notes

## Integration Points

### 1. Appointment Integration
```java
// Treatment is linked to Appointment
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "appointment_id", nullable = false)
private Appointment appointment;

// Appointment can have multiple treatments
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "appointment")
private Set<Treatment> treatments;
```

**Workflow:**
1. Patient books appointment
2. During appointment, treatments are performed
3. Each treatment is linked to the appointment
4. Appointment status updated when all treatments complete

### 2. Procedure Integration
```java
// Treatment must have a procedure
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "procedure_id", nullable = false)
private Procedure procedure;
```

**Procedure provides:**
- Default cost
- Default duration
- Procedure code for insurance
- Required materials list

### 3. Invoice Integration
```java
// InvoiceItem can link to Treatment
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "treatment_id", unique = true)
private Treatment treatment;
```

**Invoice Generation Process:**
1. Treatment marked as COMPLETED
2. System checks for open invoice
3. Creates InvoiceItem from Treatment
4. Links Treatment cost to Invoice
5. Updates patient balance

### 4. Material Tracking
```java
// Treatment tracks materials used
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "treatment", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private Set<TreatmentMaterial> materials;
```

**Material Management:**
- Records materials used per treatment
- Calculates material costs
- Updates inventory (if integrated)
- Adds to treatment total cost

## Business Rules and Validations

### Treatment Creation Rules
1. **Required Fields:**
   - Patient ID (must exist)
   - Procedure ID (must be active)
   - Doctor ID (must be active staff)
   - Treatment Date (cannot be future)
   - Cost (must be positive)
   - Status (default: PLANNED)

2. **Validation Rules:**
   ```java
   // Cost must be positive
   @Positive
   BigDecimal cost;
   
   // Tooth number validation (for dental)
   if (toothNumber != null) {
       assert toothNumber >= 11 && toothNumber <= 48;
   }
   
   // Treatment date cannot be in future
   assert !treatmentDate.isAfter(LocalDate.now());
   ```

3. **Status Transition Rules:**
   - PLANNED → SCHEDULED (when appointment booked)
   - SCHEDULED → IN_PROGRESS (when treatment starts)
   - IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED (when finished)
   - Any status → CANCELLED (with reason)

### Treatment Update Rules
1. **Editable in Status:**
   - PLANNED: All fields editable
   - SCHEDULED: Limited edits (notes, materials)
   - IN_PROGRESS: Only notes and materials
   - COMPLETED: Only notes (audit trail maintained)
   - CANCELLED: No edits allowed

2. **Cost Modifications:**
   - Allowed until invoice is PAID
   - Triggers invoice recalculation
   - Creates adjustment ledger entry

### Treatment Deletion Rules
1. **Can Delete if:**
   - Status is PLANNED
   - No invoice items linked
   - No payments received

2. **Cannot Delete if:**
   - Invoice exists (any status)
   - Status is COMPLETED
   - Part of payment plan

## Financial Integration

### Cost Calculation Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Treatment Cost Calculation])
    
    Start --> BaseCost[Get Procedure Default Cost]
    BaseCost --> CheckMaterials{Materials Used?}
    
    CheckMaterials -->|Yes| CalcMaterials[Calculate Material Costs]
    CheckMaterials -->|No| UseBase[Use Base Cost]
    
    CalcMaterials --> SumMaterials[Sum All Materials]
    SumMaterials --> AddToBase[Base + Materials]
    
    AddToBase --> CheckDiscount{Discount Applied?}
    UseBase --> CheckDiscount
    
    CheckDiscount -->|Yes| ApplyDiscount[Apply Discount %]
    CheckDiscount -->|No| FinalCost[Final Cost]
    ApplyDiscount --> FinalCost
    
    FinalCost --> UpdateTreatment[Update Treatment.cost]
    UpdateTreatment --> End([Cost Calculated])
```

### Invoice Item Creation
```java
public InvoiceItem createFromTreatment(Treatment treatment) {
    InvoiceItem item = new InvoiceItem();
    item.setTreatment(treatment);
    item.setItemType(InvoiceItemType.TREATMENT);
    item.setDescription(formatDescription(treatment));
    item.setAmount(calculateTotalCost(treatment));
    return item;
}

private String formatDescription(Treatment treatment) {
    return String.format("%s - %s (Tooth: %s)",
        treatment.getProcedure().getName(),
        treatment.getTreatmentDate(),
        treatment.getToothNumber() != null ? 
            treatment.getToothNumber() : "N/A");
}

private BigDecimal calculateTotalCost(Treatment treatment) {
    BigDecimal baseCost = treatment.getCost();
    BigDecimal materialCost = treatment.getMaterials().stream()
        .map(TreatmentMaterial::getTotalCost)
        .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
    return baseCost.add(materialCost);
}
```

### Ledger Entry Creation
```java
// When treatment is completed and invoiced
LedgerEntry entry = new LedgerEntry();
entry.setPatient(treatment.getPatient());
entry.setEntryType(LedgerEntryType.CHARGE);
entry.setAmount(treatment.getCost());
entry.setDescription("Treatment: " + treatment.getProcedure().getName());
entry.setOccurredAt(Instant.now());
```

## Implementation Details

### Service Layer Implementation

```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class TreatmentServiceImpl implements TreatmentService {
    
    @Override
    public TreatmentLogDto createTreatment(UUID patientId, TreatmentCreateRequest request) {
        // 1. Validate patient exists
        Patient patient = patientRepository.findById(patientId)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new NotFoundException("Patient not found"));
        
        // 2. Validate procedure exists and is active
        Procedure procedure = procedureRepository.findById(request.procedureId())
            .orElseThrow(() -> new NotFoundException("Procedure not found"));
        
        // 3. Validate doctor exists and is active
        Staff doctor = staffRepository.findById(request.doctorId())
            .orElseThrow(() -> new NotFoundException("Doctor not found"));
        
        // 4. Create treatment
        Treatment treatment = new Treatment();
        treatment.setPatient(patient);
        treatment.setProcedure(procedure);
        treatment.setDoctor(doctor);
        treatment.setTreatmentDate(request.treatmentDate());
        treatment.setCost(request.cost());
        treatment.setStatus(request.status());
        treatment.setToothNumber(request.toothNumber());
        treatment.setTreatmentNotes(request.treatmentNotes());
        
        // 5. Save treatment
        Treatment saved = treatmentRepository.save(treatment);
        
        // 6. If completed, trigger invoice generation
        if (saved.getStatus() == TreatmentStatus.COMPLETED) {
            invoiceService.createInvoiceItemFromTreatment(saved);
        }
        
        // 7. Return DTO
        return treatmentMapper.toDto(saved);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void completeTreatment(UUID treatmentId) {
        Treatment treatment = treatmentRepository.findById(treatmentId)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new NotFoundException("Treatment not found"));
        
        // Update status
        treatment.setStatus(TreatmentStatus.COMPLETED);
        treatmentRepository.save(treatment);
        
        // Generate invoice
        invoiceService.createInvoiceItemFromTreatment(treatment);
        
        // Update appointment status if all treatments completed
        updateAppointmentStatus(treatment.getAppointment());
        
        // Send notifications
        notificationService.sendTreatmentCompleteNotification(treatment);
    }
}
```

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Get treatments pending invoice
SELECT t.* FROM treatments t
LEFT JOIN invoice_items ii ON ii.treatment_id = t.id
WHERE t.status = 'COMPLETED' 
  AND ii.id IS NULL
  AND t.patient_id = ?;

-- Get treatment cost summary by period
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', treatment_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as treatment_count,
    SUM(cost) as total_cost,
    AVG(cost) as avg_cost
FROM treatments
WHERE treatment_date BETWEEN ? AND ?
  AND status = 'COMPLETED'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', treatment_date)
ORDER BY month;

-- Get doctor performance metrics
SELECT 
    s.full_name as doctor_name,
    COUNT(t.id) as treatments_performed,
    SUM(t.cost) as revenue_generated,
    AVG(t.cost) as avg_treatment_cost
FROM treatments t
JOIN staff s ON t.doctor_id = s.id
WHERE t.treatment_date BETWEEN ? AND ?
  AND t.status = 'COMPLETED'
GROUP BY s.id, s.full_name
ORDER BY revenue_generated DESC;
```

## Treatment Material Management

### Material Cost Calculation
```java
@Entity
public class TreatmentMaterial {
    @PrePersist
    @PreUpdate
    private void calculateTotalCost() {
        if (quantity != null && costPerUnit != null) {
            this.totalCost = quantity.multiply(costPerUnit);
        }
    }
}
```

### Inventory Integration (Future Enhancement)
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Treatment[Treatment Completed]
    Treatment --> Materials[Materials Used]
    Materials --> Inventory[Update Inventory]
    
    Inventory --> Check{Stock Level OK?}
    Check -->|Low| Alert[Generate Reorder Alert]
    Check -->|OK| Continue[Continue]
    
    Alert --> Purchase[Purchase Order]
    Continue --> Cost[Update Material Costs]
    
    Cost --> Invoice[Add to Invoice]
```

## Security and Audit

### Role-Based Access
```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('DOCTOR') or hasRole('ADMIN')")
public TreatmentLogDto createTreatment(...) { }

@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
public void deleteTreatment(...) { }

@PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('DOCTOR', 'STAFF', 'ADMIN')")
public TreatmentLogDto getTreatment(...) { }
```

### Audit Trail
- All treatment modifications logged
- Tracks who performed treatment
- Records status changes with timestamps
- Maintains cost modification history
- Links to financial transactions

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
```java
@Cacheable(value = "treatments", key = "#treatmentId")
public TreatmentLogDto findTreatmentById(UUID treatmentId) { }

@CacheEvict(value = "treatments", key = "#treatmentId")
public TreatmentLogDto updateTreatment(UUID treatmentId, ...) { }
```

### Query Optimization
- Lazy loading for relationships
- Batch fetching for materials
- Indexed columns: patient_id, doctor_id, treatment_date, status
- Composite index on (patient_id, treatment_date)

## Reporting and Analytics

### Key Metrics
1. **Treatment Volume**: Treatments per day/week/month
2. **Revenue Analysis**: Revenue by procedure type
3. **Doctor Performance**: Treatments and revenue per doctor
4. **Material Usage**: Most used materials and costs
5. **Treatment Duration**: Average time per procedure
6. **Success Rate**: Completed vs cancelled treatments

### Sample Reports
```sql
-- Daily Treatment Summary
SELECT 
    treatment_date,
    COUNT(*) as total_treatments,
    COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) as unique_patients,
    COUNT(DISTINCT doctor_id) as active_doctors,
    SUM(cost) as total_revenue,
    AVG(cost) as average_cost
FROM treatments
WHERE treatment_date = CURRENT_DATE
  AND status = 'COMPLETED'
GROUP BY treatment_date;
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Treatment Creation
- Always link to appointment when applicable
- Validate procedure is appropriate for specialty
- Check doctor availability and qualifications
- Record all materials used immediately
- Set accurate cost including materials

### 2. Status Management
- Follow status transition rules strictly
- Document reason for cancellations
- Trigger appropriate workflows on status change
- Maintain audit trail for compliance

### 3. Financial Integration
- Generate invoice items immediately upon completion
- Never modify costs after invoice is paid
- Track all cost adjustments in ledger
- Reconcile treatments with payments regularly

### 4. Data Integrity
- Use database transactions for multi-table updates
- Implement optimistic locking for concurrent edits
- Validate all foreign key relationships
- Maintain referential integrity
