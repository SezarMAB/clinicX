if i have spring boot app with keyclaok and i have angualr as frontend butt with Capacitor i create mobile app, how to add more security leavel by adding a cirtificate that have to be in desktop or mobile to be abel to signin, then based on signin data recognaize wich user

To add a **certificate-based security layer** to your Spring Boot + Keycloak + Angular (Capacitor mobile app) setup, you can implement **mutual TLS (mTLS)** or **certificate pinning**. This ensures that only clients (desktop or mobile) with the correct certificate can connect or authenticate.

Here's a **step-by-step approach**:

---

## **1. Use Mutual TLS (mTLS)**

Mutual TLS requires both the server and client to present valid certificates during the TLS handshake.

### **How it works:**

1. Your backend (Spring Boot) is configured to require a client certificate.
2. The desktop or mobile app must include a client certificate (issued by your CA).
3. Only requests with the valid certificate can reach your Keycloak or backend APIs.
4. Keycloak can be configured to extract the certificate's subject (e.g., CN) and map it to a user.

### **Spring Boot Setup:**

In `application.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    key-store: classpath:server-keystore.p12
    key-store-password: changeit
    key-store-type: PKCS12
    trust-store: classpath:truststore.p12
    trust-store-password: changeit
    client-auth: need  # 'want' for optional, 'need' for required
```

This forces clients to provide a valid certificate.

### **Keycloak Setup:**

* Configure Keycloak behind a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX) that passes the `X-SSL-CERT` header.
* Use **X.509 client certificate authentication** in Keycloak:

   * Go to **Authentication → Flows → Browser Flow → Add X509 authenticator**.

---

## **2. Certificate Pinning in Mobile App**

For Capacitor (or Angular in web), you can **pin the server certificate** so that the app only trusts your backend certificate.

* Use a Capacitor plugin like `@capacitor-community/http` with SSL pinning.
* Add your server certificate fingerprint (SHA-256) in the app, e.g.:

```typescript
Http.setServerTrustMode('pinned');
```

---

## **3. Binding Certificates to Users**

Once the TLS layer validates the client certificate:

* Extract the **certificate subject** in Spring Boot:

```java
X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate) request.getAttribute("javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate");
String subjectDN = cert.getSubjectDN().getName();
```

* Use `subjectDN` to map to your Keycloak user (via custom Keycloak authenticator or SPI).

---

## **4. Recommended Hybrid Approach**

1. **Frontend Login Flow:**

   * User logs in via Keycloak (OIDC).
   * Spring Boot checks both **JWT token** (user identity) and **client certificate** (device identity).
2. **Mapping User & Device:**

   * Maintain a table mapping `(userId, cert fingerprint)` to ensure only allowed devices.

---

## **5. Security Benefits**

* Even if JWT tokens are stolen, an attacker **cannot** call your API without the valid client certificate.
* You can revoke a device by revoking its certificate.

## **Next Steps**

Would you like me to **give you a sample implementation** of **Spring Boot + Keycloak + mTLS**, including a small Capacitor code snippet for certificate pinning?
